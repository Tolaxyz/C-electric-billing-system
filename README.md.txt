The program uses C header files <stdio.h>
which allows for standard input and output libaries
And also a C header file <conio.h> used mostly by MS-DOS compilers to provide console input/output. It is not part of the C standard library or ISO C, nor is it defined by POSIX
which was used to implement the getch function 


This C program takes user inputs and calculates the output using a scanf function whereby the total units consumed are calculated using the 
(*) operator to multiply the units by the charge on that given unit.



N.B : this version of the code created is open source and is calculated in naira.
